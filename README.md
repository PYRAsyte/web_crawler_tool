## Overview
A web crawler (also known as a web spider, web robot, or search engine bot) is a software tool that automatically navigates and indexes websites by following hyperlinks on web pages. Web crawlers are primarily used to gather information from websites, either for indexing by search engines or for specific data collection tasks.

## How Web Crawlers Work:
1. **Start with a Seed URL:**
The crawler begins with an initial URL (called the seed URL), which is typically provided by the user.

2. **Fetch the Page:**
The crawler sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the URL and fetches the content of the page (usually HTML).

3. **Parse the Page:**
The crawler analyzes the content of the page, extracting information such as hyperlinks, metadata, and other relevant data like form parameters.

4. **Follow Links:**
The crawler identifies all the links on the page and decides whether to visit them. It then repeats the process for each new URL, thus traversing the web like a spider building a web.

5. **Store or Process Data:**
The collected data, such as URLs, text content, images, or parameters, can be stored in a database or file for further processing, analysis, or indexing.
## Types of Web Crawlers:
1. **Search Engine Crawlers:**
These crawlers are used by search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo to index web pages. The crawlers systematically visit pages and add them to the search engine's index, enabling users to search for and discover content.

2. **Focused Web Crawlers:**
These crawlers are specialized and target specific types of content. For example, a crawler might only look for job listings, academic papers, or price information.

3. **Data Scrapers:**
Sometimes, web crawlers are used for data scraping, where the goal is to extract specific information from a website (e.g., product prices, contact information, or news articles).
## Use Cases of Web Crawlers:
1. Search Engine Indexing: Collecting and indexing web pages to enable search engines to return relevant results to users' queries.
2. Price Comparison: Crawling e-commerce websites to gather pricing data for comparison.
3. Content Aggregation: Collecting articles, news, or blog posts from various websites to display on a single platform.
4. Monitoring and Analysis: Monitoring competitors' websites for changes or collecting data for market research.
3 Ethical Considerations:
1. Respect robots.txt: As mentioned earlier, websites use robots.txt files to specify which parts of the site crawlers can access. Ethical crawlers respect these rules to avoid overloading servers or accessing restricted content.
2. Rate Limiting: Crawlers should not overwhelm servers with too many requests in a short time, as this can cause performance issues or get the IP address blocked.
3. Legal Compliance: Web crawling can raise legal issues, particularly if it involves bypassing restrictions or collecting sensitive information. Always ensure your crawling activities comply with the website's terms of service and applicable laws.
## Examples:
1. Googlebot: The crawler used by Google to discover and index web pages for its search engine.
2. Wayback Machine: A crawler that archives web pages for historical reference in the Internet Archive.
3. Custom Crawlers: Tools developed for specific needs, such as gathering data for academic research or monitoring product prices.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - argparse
  - requests
  - BeautifulSoup
  - re
  - json
  - urlparse
  - parse_qs
  - ThreadPoolExecutor
  - RobotFileParser
## Usage
1. **Open Command Line:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your web_crawler.py script is located.

2. **Run the Script:** Use the following command to run the web crawler, providing the target URL and any options:

  ```bash
  python web_crawler.py https://example.com -o output.json -t 10
  ```
  - *URL:* Replace https://example.com with the URL you want to crawl.
  - *-o (Output File):* Specify the name of the output file (e.g., output.json).
  - *-t (Threads):* Set the number of threads for multi-threaded crawling (e.g., 10).
3. **View the Output:** Once the script finishes crawling, youâ€™ll find the results in the specified output file (e.g., output.json). The file will contain all the extracted URL parameters from the crawled pages.
